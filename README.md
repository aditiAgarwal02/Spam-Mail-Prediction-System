# Spam-Mail-Prediction-System
This project aims to classify emails as spam or not spam using Logistic Regression. The process involves cleaning and preprocessing email data, converting text data into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization, and training a Logistic Regression model to make predictions. By leveraging these techniques, the system provides an efficient and accurate way to identify spam emails.
